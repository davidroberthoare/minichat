        <p class="subtitle">MiniChat is a free service. There is no registration, and no personal information is collected. No software is downloaded to your computer, and nothing needs to be installed.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Connections are directly peer-to-peer. This means that your video and chats are not running through our servers, so we don't see them or log them in any way.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Because your video connections are established between each other directly, typically this limits the number of browsers that can connect to one session to about 4 or 5.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">All rooms are PUBLIC, and can be visited simply by entering the appropriate URL.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">MiniChat is provided with no warranty or service guarantee whatsoever, and participants are respectfully reminded that they use it at their own risk.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">MiniChat is built on WebRTC, and some brilliant <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection">open-source software by Muaz Khan.</a></p>
        <p class="subtitle">Be safe, and enjoy :)</a></p>
